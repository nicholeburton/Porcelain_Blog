# Porcelain_Blog

A very quick sample of what a blog post could look like.

# Core sections
- Header. With 'about', the Porcelain Logo, and 'contact'. The idea for the 'about' and 'contact' links is that eventually they would bring up an overlay modal with the info on it.
- Article. All parts are optional, including the super large "hero" image. Added some h2s to help break up the text a little bit. Images are inline with paragraphs to maintain readability.
- Suggested Articles. Perhaps in the form of a footer. This is also intended to be the basic composition of any article.

# What remains
- Front page. Likely to be a super simple list of articles. It's all we need.
- Gotta get that header working.
- Gotta review and clean up the code when it's not 6am.
- Need to fix hanging numbers / bullets when responsive. I've got a feeling I'll have to de-hang them. Typography life chose me.

This dude is fully responsive. Lock n' load.
